# Penguin_Analyst
Penguin Analyst consist of data visualization and classification of penguin species based on specified features. 

## Tools
This project aims to utilize two key data analysis techniques - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and classification of penguin species based on specified features.

## Project stages 
In the initial stage of the project, PCA will be applied to reduce the number of data dimensions. PCA is a statistical technique that transforms a set of variables into a new space where the variables are uncorrelated (orthogonal) and ordered by their variance. This will allow us to decrease the number of features while retaining as much information contained in the data as possible. Next, we will proceed to visualize the data in the reduced space using visualization techniques such as 2D plots. In the final phase of the project, we will implement the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for penguin species classification. KNN is a simple supervised learning algorithm that classifies new samples based on their nearest neighbors from the training set. We will adjust KNN parameters such as the number of neighbors to achieve optimal model performance.
